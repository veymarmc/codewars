Tasks to do:
  - [o] make the frequencies algorithm given any text.
  - [o] study the examples of the tests to know exactly how to encode and decode.
  - [x] if the previous information is not enough, study the Huffman Encodding in order to check more examples.
  - [o] with the result of the precious information recheck and study binary tree data structure to solve the problem.
  - [o] make the encode algorithm
  - [o] make the decode algorithm
  - [o] study a little bit the tests in order to begin with unit tests.
