# Tasks to do:
  - [x] make the frequencies algorithm given any text .
  - [x] study the examples of the tests to know exactly how to encode and decode.
  - [x] if the previous information is not enough, study the Huffman Encodding in order to check more examples.
    - Data: the given string
    - needed structures:
      - An array of trees
        - these tress at the beginning are only a node with weight of each letter
        - the weight of each letter is the frequency of it in the given string.
        - these should be ordered according to the weights.
      - the tree has the following components:
        - a letter (could be null if this is a branch node)
        - the weight
        - the children if any (exactly two since this is a binary tree, or can be null).
        - the value of binary child, if left child this is zero, otherwise one.
      - the decoded array has the following components:
        - the letter
        - the respective code
          - this code is gotten by:
          - going through the root to the leaf which contain the letter.
          - take all the code values of the nodes (left: 0, right: 1)
          - as the root node doesn't have another sibling it doesn't have a code value.
    - the algorithm to encode:
      - get the frequencies of each letter of the given string.
      - put each of them in a tree with the value of the children to null.
      - (*) order the trees acording to the root weight.
      - take the two less weighed trees and join then into a new tree.
        - order the two children the smaller to the left and the bigger to the right.
        - all left children should have a zero value of code and the left ones: one.
        - The new root should have the summation of its children weights as its weight.
        - The new root doesn't have a letter since this is a branch node.
      - delete the previous selected trees.
      - put the new tree in the tree array.
      - ask if the tree array length is 1
        - if is greater go to (*)
        - if so return the array of trees.
      - decode each letter:
        - this code is gotten by:
        - going through the root to the leaf which contain the letter.
        - take all the code values of the nodes (left: 0, right: 1)
        - as the root node doesn't have another sibling it doesn't have a code value.
      - replace each code instead of each letter of the given string.

    - the algorithm to decode:
      - have the hauffman tree
      - traverse each bit to the hauffman tree and find the respective letter.
  - [x] with the result of the previous information recheck and study binary tree data structure to solve the problem.
  - [x] make the huffman tree construction algorithm.
  - [x] make the encode algorithm
  - [x] make the decode algorithm
  - [x] study a little bit the tests in order to begin with unit tests.
