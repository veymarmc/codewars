## Project information:

- **data**:
  - n, size of the spiral.
  - two characters ('0', '1') to build the spiral.
- **description**: Make 2 spirals the outher one always if the one composed by 'ones' and the other by 'zeros'.
- **return value**: should be an array of arrays.
- **min size:** 5.
- **Algorithm:**
  - [x] find the pattern
  - [x] make the algorithm for implementing the patthern
  - [ ] implement the algorithm.
    - [x] create the matrix with 0's
    - [x] see the data structures to work
    - [x] check when the algorithm will finish
  - [x] test the algorithm
    - [x] recheck how to uni-test in jest
    - [x] have a vs code plugin to work with jest
