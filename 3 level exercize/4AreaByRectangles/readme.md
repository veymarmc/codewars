# Calculate Rectangle steps:

1. Understand the exercise  --> done
2. Make the exercise manually
3. Devise the algorithm.
4. Implement the algorithm.
5. Test the solution. 



## Rules about the intersection:

- the intersection has to be substracted of total of the areas.


## Approach to follow:
- First after rearching I had 2 ways of solving:
  - brute force method.
  - sweep line(with a segment tree) algorithm
- Due to the expectations of the exercise the brute force method seems the ideal.
